the size of the PCB is 183 x 169mm 2 layers

128x MIC4127 SOIC8
32x 74hc595 SOIC16
160x 0.1uf capacitors 50v 0805
1x dc barrel
head connectors for the FPGA (2x22) and lateral connectors

256x transducers ideally the ones used for TinyLev (Check for Instructables Acoustic Levitator)

Other pin compatible drivers are: TC4427a or MIC4127  / MIC4478 for 32V but pricey as hell
